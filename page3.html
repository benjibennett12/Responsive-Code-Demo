            <h1>How to use Responsive Design</h1>
            <strong>
                <br></br>
                <p>Responsive Design can be achieved through 2 Ways:</p>
            </strong> <br></br>
            <p>First method involves the usage of the Viewport, which is located in your HTML. You can set a viewport
                within your metadata.
                <br></br>
                <strong>EXAMPLE:</strong>"meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                <br></br>
                Basicially this tag signifys that "width=device-width" tells our browser to set the
                width of the viewport to the device's screen width whiile "initial-scale=1.0" sets the
                intial zoom level to 100%. Basicially so the webpage isnt Zoomed in or Out by default
                <br></br>
                Second method is the usage of Media Queries whic are located in your CSS and are represented by the
                "@media () {}"
                <br></br>
                <strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {}
                <br></br>
                First, you define conditions or parameters, such as your screen's width, within the parentheses.
                Within the media query, you specify the CSS styles you want to apply when the condition is met.
                This allows you to change font sizes, colors, and more based on your parameters, ensuring that
                they fit the screen as desired."
